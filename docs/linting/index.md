## What is Linting?

Linting is a static code analysis process used to identify potential programming errors, bugs, and stylistic issues in
source code. It helps developers maintain code quality, readability, and consistency. By using linting tools,
programmers can catch common mistakes and adhere to best practices during development.

## How to Perform Linting in Java

Performing linting in Java involves using specialized tools and configurations to analyze Java source code for potential
issues. Here are the general steps to perform linting in Java:

1. **Choose a Linting Tool:** There are several linting tools available for Java, such as Checkstyle, PMD, and FindBugs.
   Choose a tool that best suits your project's requirements.

2. **Install the Linting Tool:** Once you've chosen a linting tool, you need to install it in your development
   environment.

3. **Configuration:** Configure the linting tool to specify the rules and coding standards you want to enforce.

4. **Run Linting Analysis:** Run the linting tool against your Java source code. It will generate reports highlighting
   potential issues and violations of coding standards.

5. **Fix the Issues:** Review the linting reports and address the identified issues in your code.

6. **Automate Linting (Optional):** Consider integrating the linting process into your build system or Continuous
   Integration (CI) pipeline to automate the analysis.

## Linting Libraries in Java

There are several popular linting libraries available for Java, each offering unique features and rule sets. Some common
linting libraries are:

1. **Checkstyle:** Checkstyle is a widely used linting tool for enforcing coding standards. It focuses on code
   formatting, naming conventions, and code structure.

2. **PMD:** PMD is a static source code analyzer that detects common programming flaws, potential bugs, and inefficient
   code.

3. **FindBugs:** FindBugs is another static analysis tool that identifies potential bugs in Java code, including null
   pointer dereferences and concurrency issues.

4. **SonarQube:** While not just a linting tool, SonarQube offers powerful code analysis capabilities and provides a
   comprehensive view of code quality and security issues.

## IDE Integration for Linting

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) integration is crucial for enabling real-time linting feedback during code
development. Most modern IDEs offer plugins or built-in support for linting tools. Here's how to integrate linting into
your IDE:

1. **Install Linting Plugin:** Install the appropriate plugin for your chosen linting tool from your IDE's marketplace.

2. **Configure the Plugin:** Configure the plugin to use the same linting rules and configurations as in your project.

3. **Real-time Feedback:** As you write code, the linting plugin will provide real-time feedback, highlighting potential
   issues directly in the code editor.

4. **On-Demand Linting:** You can also trigger linting manually to perform a full analysis of your codebase and receive
   a detailed report.

By integrating linting into your IDE, you can catch errors and maintain code quality while coding, leading to more
efficient development.

Remember that linting is just one aspect of maintaining high-quality code, and it should be complemented with other
testing and review processes.

## Maven Usage of Linting

I read that it is also possible to use linters before-pushing, example usage “mvn pmd:pmd”.
